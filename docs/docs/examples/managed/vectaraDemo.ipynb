    "Vectara provides an end-to-end managed service for Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG, which includes:\n",
    "1. A way to extract text from document files and chunk them into sentences.\n",
    "2. The state-of-the-art [Boomerang](https://vectara.com/how-boomerang-takes-retrieval-augmented-generation-to-the-next-level-via-grounded-generation/) embeddings model. Each text chunk is encoded into a vector embedding using Boomerang, and stored in the Vectara internal vector store. Thus, when using Vectara with LlamaIndex you do not need to call a separate embedding model - this happens automatically within the Vectara backend.\n",
    "3. A query service that automatically encodes the query into embedding, and retrieves the most relevant text segments (including support for [Hybrid Search](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/lexical-matching) and [MMR](https://vectara.com/get-diverse-results-and-comprehensive-summaries-with-vectaras-mmr-reranker/), [Multilingual](https://vectara.com/blog/unlocking-the-state-of-the-art-reranker-introducing-the-vectara-multilingual-reranker_v1/), or [User Defined Function](https://vectara.com/blog/introducing-user-defined-functions-for-vectara/) reranking)\n",
    "4.

Risks also involve safety concerns, such as AI systems violating the safety of individuals, and the proliferation of harmful technologies like AI-enabled \"nudification\" tools. Furthermore, the incorrect penalization by AI systems, as seen in the case of AI-powered cameras in delivery vans, can lead to adverse consequences for individuals. To mitigate these risks, ongoing transparency, participatory design, explanations for stakeholders, and public consultation are essential. Organizations are implementing innovative solutions like risk assessments, auditing mechanisms, and monitoring tools to address safety and efficacy concerns related to AI systems. The involvement of communities and stakeholders in the design and evaluation of AI systems is crucial to ensure trustworthiness and mitigate potential harms.\n",

      "Response: To stop malicious individuals from exploiting artificial intelligence, measures can be taken such as implementing ethical principles for the use of AI, ensuring transparency, accountability, and regular monitoring of AI systems, conducting equity assessments, using representative data, protecting against biases, and providing clear organizational oversight. Additionally, it is crucial to address algorithmic discrimination through proactive measures, ongoing disparity testing, and independent evaluations to protect individuals and communities from unjust treatment based on various characteristics. Furthermore, incorporating safeguards like plain language reporting, algorithmic impact assessments, and public disclosure of mitigation efforts can help prevent the misuse of AI by malicious actors [1][2][4].\n",
